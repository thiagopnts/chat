About the project
-----------------

The project was developed using JavaScript in the front-end
and in the backend. The original idea was to implement a chat
using node.js and socket.io(classical example) with a nice UI.
I really think interessing the idea of real-time web apps, making
a push with the information notifying all the connected clients
when necessary, I have great interest in this evented I/O area,
and in the way it can scale, using advanced computer network and
operational system concepts. Was used a micro-framework too, called
ExpressJS to handle the HTTP connections and the socket.io to
broadcast the messages between the users.
I developed this project to help me to learn and understand more
about server-side javascript and front-end development, using HTML5,
CSS3 and jQuery.
